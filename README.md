# Emotion Detection Project

This repository contains a complete project on Emotion Detection. The project utilizes deep learning techniques to classify different human emotions based on facial expressions.

## Data Preprocessing

The model takes RGB images as input and converts them into grayscale. This is because the model has been trained on grayscale images. The conversion from RGB to grayscale helps in reducing the complexity of the model while still maintaining the essential features needed for emotion detection.

## Model Architectures

Several different architectures were experimented with during the development of this project, including **VGG16**, **ResNet**, and a **simple CNN**. Each architecture brought its own strengths and weaknesses to the task, and their performances were carefully evaluated and compared.

- **VGG16** and **ResNet** are well-known architectures that have shown great success in image classification tasks. They were fine-tuned for the emotion detection task in this project.
- The **simple CNN**, while less complex, provided a baseline performance and helped in understanding the nuances of the task.

## Model Performance

The model used in this project has achieved an accuracy of **66%**. While there is room for improvement, this level of accuracy provides a solid foundation for understanding and predicting emotional states.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into various components including data preprocessing, model training, and results evaluation. Each component plays a crucial role in the overall emotion detection pipeline.

## Future Work

Future work will focus on improving the model's accuracy and robustness. This could involve exploring more complex models, incorporating more data, or fine-tuning the existing model. Additionally, other state-of-the-art architectures could be explored to further improve the system's performance.
